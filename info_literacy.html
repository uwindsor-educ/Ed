                <h2>What is Information Literacy?</h2>
                <p>Information Literacy refers to an individual's comprehensive ability in the information age to effectively acquire, evaluate, use, and share information. This skill set includes identifying reliable sources, critical thinking about information, and the ethical and legal use of information. Information literacy has become an essential skill in today's society, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital environment.</p>

                    <li><strong>Information Retrieval Skills:</strong> The ability to effectively search for and obtain information through various channels (e.g., libraries, the internet, databases).
